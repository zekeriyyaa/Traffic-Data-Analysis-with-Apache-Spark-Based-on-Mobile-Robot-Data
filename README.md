# Traffic-Data-Analysis-with-Spark
A smart factory has many smart systems like autonomous guided vehicle. These all are generate many data like position and speed continuously. So, it is needed to analysis these data and get some useful result. For this purpose, the datas that generated from AGV analyzied with using [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org). And desktop app improved and results is visualised for understanding easily using [PyQT5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/).

AGV is generated its current position and speed data 150 times per minute. And these data store MongoDB database as a **packet**. Each packet has position, speed, datetime and ID datas. In addition, some information about the way which is AGV is travel on is received from MsSQL database. 
**Using these datas, five analysis that is shown below is reached:**
- Travel time
- Waiting time 
- Average speed
- Occupancy
- Density
