# Traffic-Data-Analysis-with-Spark-Based-on-Mobile-Robot-Data
There could be a traffic in smart factories caused by autonomous transport vehicles (ATVs). So, it is needed to analyzed the data generated by ATV and produce useful feedback to system to enhance the system productivity. For this purpose, five analysis are done such as travel time, waiting time, average speed, occupancy and density and the results were visualized. 

The datas that generated from AGV analyzied with using [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org). And desktop app improved and results is visualised for understanding easily using [PyQT5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/).This project has been developed within [ifarlab](https://ifarlab.ogu.edu.tr).

System architecture is shown below:

#### [Data-Analysis-with-Spark](https://github.com/zekeriyyaa/Traffic-Data-Analysis-with-Spark/tree/master/Data-Analysis-with-Spark)

AGV is generated its current position and speed data 150 times per minute. And these data store MongoDB database as a **packet**. Each packet has position, speed, datetime and ID datas as shown below. In addition, some information about the way which is AGV is travel on is received from MsSQL database. <br/>

MongoDB packet instance:

**Using these datas, five analysis that is shown below is made:**
- **Travel time**: A time between AGV start moving and stop. It is reached for each way and vehicle separately.
- **Waiting time**: A time between AGV stoped and start moving again. It is reached for each way and vehicle separately.
- **Average speed**: AGV's average speed. It is reached for each way separately.
- **Occupancy**: It is reached for each way seperately. (way lenght) / (number of vehicle * vehicle length) 
- **Density**: It is reached for aech way separately.  ( number of vehicle / way length )


#### [Analysis-Result-Visualization-PyQT5](https://github.com/zekeriyyaa/Traffic-Data-Analysis-with-Spark/tree/master/Analysis-Result-Visualization-PyQT5)
The desktop app is improved. So, result of the analysis has visualized to easly understanding. At the app, you can select way and time interval which to show all analysis result. 
The desktop app look like as shown below:

And also you can select which type of analysis that you want to visualized for a way that you already specified.
The speed analysis of all way is shown as below ( **red**: low speed **green**: medium speed **yellow**: high speed ) :
