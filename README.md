# Traffic-Data-Analysis-with-Spark
A smart factory has many smart systems like autonomous guided vehicle. These all are generate many data like position and speed continuously. So, it is needed to analysis these data and get some useful result. For this purpose, the datas that generated from AGV analyzied with using [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org). And desktop app improved and results is visualised for understanding easily using [PyQT5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/).

AGV is generated its current position and speed data namely **packet** 150 times per minute.
